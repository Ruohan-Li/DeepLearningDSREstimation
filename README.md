# DeepLearningDSREstimation

## Title


## Abstract

## Models
The configuration of each model are summarized in DSR_Models.ipynb file. The final models are also uploaded as .h5 file. 
The TensorFlow 2.0.0 are used for traning DenseNET and CNNGRU models and the TensorFlow 2.7.0 are used for training MLP and BiGRU.

## Dataset
Reduced training dataset of each model is uploaded. The dataset has been pre-processed and normalized.
